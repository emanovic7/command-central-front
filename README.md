## General info
This is a web Application (and future mobile app) that encompases the functionality
of some popular apps. I built it after Tony Stark's Artificial Assistant, JARVIS (which
stands for Just A Rather Intelligent System). That AI was one of the reasons I started
looking seriously into programming when I was studying physics in College.

This app does things other standalone apps do, such as getting Live Weather Information,
Current News, Directions and Routes (Maps), Sports Information, etc.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Ruby, Ruby on Rails
* React, Redux
* Material UI

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
